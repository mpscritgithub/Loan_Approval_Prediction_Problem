Life Cycle Of ML Project 
Data Cleaning : Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial for the model's accuracy and generalization. We may need to impute missing values, standardize or normalize features, and deal with any data anomalies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and gain insights. Visualization tools can be helpful in this phase.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's performance. This might involve transforming variables, creating interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your problem. Common algorithms for loan approval prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the training dataset. This involves feeding the algorithm the features and corresponding labels and letting it learn the patterns in the data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
